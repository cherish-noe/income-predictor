# Income Predictor

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K annually based on demographic and job-related data. The project includes the following components:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and prepare the dataset for model training.

2. **Model Training:** The predictive model is trained using a decision tree classifier algorithm.

3. **Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated to assess its performance and accuracy in predicting income levels.

4. **Deployment:** The model is deployed as a simple web application using Flask, allowing users to input their demographic and job-related information to obtain income predictions.

The goal of this project is to provide a practical tool for predicting income levels and to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques in solving real-world problems.
